I took some parts of the Iconified Header Links and Slick Image Gallery theme components made by Johani : 

https://meta.discourse.org/t/iconified-header-links/86307 (adding fa5 icons in the theme component)
https://meta.discourse.org/t/slick-image-gallery/81952 (manager the translations inside the theme component)
